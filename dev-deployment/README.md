# ArcDeploy Development Deployment

This directory contains development-specific deployment tools and guides for ArcDeploy that are not included in the main production repository.

## Overview

The development deployment folder provides manual installation procedures and scripts for environments where:
- You have root SSH access to a fresh Ubuntu server
- You need to manually create the arcblock user
- You want to understand each step of the deployment process
- Cloud-init is not available or preferred

## Contents

### ðŸ“– Documentation
- **`MANUAL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive step-by-step manual installation guide
- **`README.md`** - This file

### ðŸ”§ Scripts
- **`manual-install.sh`** - Automated script for manual installation process

## When to Use This

Use the development deployment approach when:

1. **Root Server Access**: You have a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 server with root SSH access
2. **Manual Setup Required**: Cloud-init is not available or you prefer manual control
3. **Learning/Development**: You want to understand each step of the installation
4. **Custom Environments**: You need to modify the installation process
5. **Troubleshooting**: You're debugging installation issues

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Script Installation

```bash
# As root on your Ubuntu 22.04 server
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pocklabs/ArcDeploy/main/dev-deployment/manual-install.sh
chmod +x manual-install.sh
./manual-install.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step Installation

1. Download the manual installation guide:
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pocklabs/ArcDeploy/main/dev-deployment/MANUAL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
   ```

2. Follow the comprehensive guide step by step

## Prerequisites

- **Server**: Fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS installation
- **Access**: Root SSH access with SSH key authentication
- **Resources**: Minimum 4GB RAM, 40GB disk space, 4 CPU cores
- **Network**: Internet connectivity for package downloads
- **SSH Key**: Ed25519 or RSA public key for arcblock user

## Installation Process Overview

The manual installation process includes:

### Phase 1: System Preparation
- System package updates
- Essential package installation
- Basic firewall configuration

### Phase 2: User & Security Setup
- Create arcblock user with sudo privileges
- Configure SSH key authentication
- Implement SSH hardening (port 2222, key-only auth)
- Disable root login

### Phase 3: Application Stack
- Install Node.js LTS
- Install Blocklet CLI globally
- Configure Redis backend
- Set up Nginx reverse proxy

### Phase 4: Security Hardening
- Configure Fail2ban intrusion detection
- Set up UFW firewall rules
- Apply system hardening parameters
- Configure resource limits

### Phase 5: Service Configuration
- Initialize Blocklet Server
- Create systemd service
- Set up health monitoring
- Configure automated health checks

### Phase 6: Validation & Testing
- Comprehensive system testing
- Security validation
- Service verification
- Performance checks

## Security Features

The manual installation implements comprehensive security:

- âœ… **SSH Hardening**: Port 2222, key-only authentication, root disabled
- âœ… **Firewall Protection**: UFW with minimal required ports
- âœ… **Intrusion Detection**: Fail2ban monitoring SSH and web services
- âœ… **Service Isolation**: Non-root execution with proper permissions
- âœ… **System Hardening**: Kernel parameters and resource limits
- âœ… **Monitoring**: Automated health checks every 5 minutes

## Post-Installation

After successful installation:

### Access Information
```bash
# SSH Access
ssh -p 2222 arcblock@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Web Interfaces
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080  # Blocklet Server
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:80    # Nginx Proxy
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status blocklet-server

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u blocklet-server -f

# Run health check
/opt/blocklet-server/healthcheck.sh
```

### Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pocklabs/ArcDeploy/main/scripts/validate-setup.sh | bash
```

## Differences from Production Deployment

| Aspect | Production (cloud-init) | Development (manual) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Setup Method** | Automated cloud-init | Manual step-by-step |
| **User Creation** | Automatic | Manual root â†’ arcblock |
| **Initial Access** | SSH key in cloud-init | Root SSH then arcblock |
| **Customization** | Limited to cloud-init | Full control at each step |
| **Learning Value** | Black box | Educational |
| **Time Required** | 5-10 minutes | 30-60 minutes |
| **Troubleshooting** | More difficult | Step-by-step debugging |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SSH Connection Problems**
   - Verify firewall allows port 2222
   - Check SSH service status
   - Validate SSH key format

2. **Service Startup Issues**
   - Check Node.js installation
   - Verify Blocklet CLI accessibility
   - Review systemd service logs

3. **Permission Problems**
   - Ensure proper ownership of /opt/blocklet-server
   - Verify arcblock user has sudo access
   - Check file permissions

### Getting Help

- **Installation Guide**: Detailed troubleshooting in `MANUAL_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`
- **Main Documentation**: Refer to main ArcDeploy repository
- **Issues**: Create GitHub issue with detailed error information
- **Validation**: Use provided validation scripts
