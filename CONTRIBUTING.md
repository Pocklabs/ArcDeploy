## üîí Security Guidelines

### Security-First Approach

- **No real credentials**: Use placeholders only
- **Secure defaults**: Follow security best practices
- **Input validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Minimal exposure**: Limit open ports and services

### Reporting Security Issues

- **Private reporting**: Use GitHub Security Advisories
- **No public disclosure**: Don't create public issues for security bugs
- **Responsible disclosure**: Allow time for fixes before disclosure

## üìö Style Guidelines

### YAML Style

```yaml
# Good: Clear, commented, consistent indentation
users:
  - name: arc
    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
    shell: /bin/bash
    # SSH key will be added during deployment
    ssh_authorized_keys:
      - "SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_PLACEHOLDER"

# Bad: No comments, inconsistent formatting
users:
- name: arc
  sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
  shell: /bin/bash
  ssh_authorized_keys: ["SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_PLACEHOLDER"]
```

### Documentation Style

```markdown
# Good: Clear headings, practical examples
## Installing on AWS

1. **Launch EC2 instance** with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
2. **Configure security group** to allow ports 22, 80, 443
3. **Add cloud-init configuration** in user data

# Bad: Vague, no examples
## AWS
Configure AWS and deploy.
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Required Testing

- [ ] **Syntax validation**: YAML parses correctly
- [ ] **Cloud deployment**: Works on at least one cloud provider
- [ ] **Service functionality**: All services start and work
- [ ] **Security verification**: No security regressions
- [ ] **Documentation accuracy**: All docs are current

### Testing Checklist
